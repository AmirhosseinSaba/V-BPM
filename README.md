Vectorial beam propagation method for optical simulation

This MatLab code provides a vectorial beam propagation method for optical simulation of anisotropic materials. This method is theoretically based on Fourier beam propagation method and all the details explained inthe suplementrary document of [1]. To use this code, I will appriciate to cite [1].
